# Shop Display

## Description

This project is a simple internal website for displaying useful information on a large TV on the shop floor.

## How to run this project
---

To start the test server and make it available to other machines on the network, run

`python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

I set up a mock up page that can be used for testing layout ideas. it is available at the path /workorders/mockup

for example:

127.0.0.1:8000/workorders/mockup

## How to build this project

### Setting up the development environment
---

The website is built with Django 2 and Python 3. The current plan is to deploy it on an Apache web server running on a raspberry pi 3.

#### Virtual Environment
---

The project is set up to use a virtual python environment to manage package dependencies. Since the shop display is probably the only project that will run on the Pi, this is probably an optional step, but it may help when working on the project on other computers.

On the pi the virtual environment is located at

`~/projects/envs/shopdisplayenv/`

The environment can be activated by running the shell command

`source ~/projects/envs/shopdisplayenv/bin/activate`

The environment can be deactivated at any time with

`deactivate`

Any python packages installed using pip while the environment is active will only be installed in the virtual environment. This is useful because any packages that are installed systemwide will not affect the project environment, and also because it provides a record of all project dependencies.

#### requirements.txt
---

Any python packages added with pip should be listed in the requirements.txt file. To automatically update the file: make sure the virtual environment is active, navigate to the project directory (the folder that contains requirements.txt) then run

`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

This should be done any time a new package is added with pip.

To install all of the packages listed in the requirements.txt file: make sure the virtual environment is active, navigate to the project directory, then run

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#### Example setup on a new computer
---

Make sure python3 and pip3 are installed. (Installing python3 also installs pip3.)

If you are going to use a virtual environment, you also need the package virtualenv. To install:

`pip3 install virtualenv`

From the command line:

- Navigate to the folder that you would like to place your project folder in
- `git clone https://github.com/ConvertingSystemsInc/shop_display.git`
- `cd shop_display`

-- Optional steps if using a virtual environment --

- `virtualenv shopdisplayenv`
    - This step creates a virtual environment called shopdisplayenv
    - Optionally, you might choose to locate your virtual environments in a centralized place outside of the project folder. It doesn't matter which way you do it. Just don't add the virtualenv files to the git repo if you do choose to do it inside the project folder.

- `source shopdisplayenv/bin/activate`
    - (or the location of your env if you placed it somewhere else)

-- End optional steps --

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

At this point, the project should be ready to run. For help with django, see the django documentation.

Need to write a script to install and create a virtual env.
Goal is to be able to execute one script to prepare the environment and one to start the project
